![alt Screenshot_1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZeeroOG/AD-PasswordGenerator/master/Screenshot_1.png)

This is a simple password generator that meets Active Directory password requirements and automatically copies it into the clipboard.

It has been made to help (lazy?) sysadmins create user accounts faster.

**It's only made for Windows !**

You can download it in the *releases* section.
